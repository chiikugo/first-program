 ## Functionallity

    Our program's main function is to take the user's name and favorite number and return a simple print statement with the values they inputted. The name will take intergers, decimals, and words, While the number can only be an integer or float.
    
 ## Installation
     After installing and initiallizing git by typing in "git" in terminal, you would type in 'clone [url]', and cd into the folder. You would then run the program by typing in 'python program1.py.'
     
 ## Contribution
     Feel free to extend the code by asking for more inputs and if you would like, you could put them into a library with the user's name and the things they favor. Make a pull request and I will respond!
